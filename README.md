Auto Siege is a game where, each round, players spend gold to improve their offense and defense. The better your ally Attackers perform against opposing towers, the more damage is dealt. The last player standing wins.
Shop Phase:
Spend gold to buy Attackers, Defenders, or Level Ups. Place Towers on your board and order your Attackers optimally.  Edit your path by connecting the start and end tiles. 
Buy Level Ups to: 
Improve the quality of your shop
Increase the number of Attackers sent
Increase the number of Towers allowed on your board
Expand the number of tiles your path can use​
Battle Phase:
Players are paired for battle. Attackers on each player's numbered tiles are sent to the opposing player's board.​
Attackers of the same Tribe can have synergies with each other. For example, the Undead Giant becomes stronger when other Undead die nearby, and Crumble summons multiple Undead upon death. ​Towers of the same Tribe also have synergies. For example, Arcane Towers increase their chance of double casting their abilities when there are more Arcane Towers on the board.
Stacking Tower synergies and building Attacker compositions that scale into the late game is the key to victory.
